changes:
  - bugfix: Toggling bowties and flannel shirts should now display the correct messages
      based on toggle state.
  - bugfix: Cryopods should hopefully stop double-announcing flushing some people.
      Admin/error logs will still occur though as the root issue hasn't been found
      and fixed yet.
  - bugfix: The replica anti-material rifle now properly accepts pistol bullets instead
      of demanding pistol magazines that don't work with this rifle.
  - admin: Additional debug logs have been added for certain runtimes to help troubleshoot
      them when they occur.
