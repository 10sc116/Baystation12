  - rscadd: Fire, explosion, EMP, projectile, and general-hitting-things damage has
      been generally applied to all atoms currently using standardized health. This
      means you can now damage anything using standardized health with melee attacks,
      fire, guns, explosions, and in some cases, EMPs. Contents of relevant objects
      such as closets will also take damage from fire or explosions, and projectiles
      that havs the penetrating trait. This should not affect anything not currently
      using standardized health. Please report any bugs including things that aren't
      taking damage, or things that seem to be getting hit twice when clicked once.
