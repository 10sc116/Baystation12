changes:
  - rscadd: Nurse spiders can now 'feed' a small number of spiderlings to cause them
      to begin growing.
  - rscadd: Spiders can now use ladders. Cower in fear.
  - bugfix: Fixed guard/nurse spiders not pairing up, so guards will now go 'berserk'
      when their nurse is killed.
  - bugfix: Nurse spiders will no longer cocoon other spiders (or themselves).
  - tweak: Nurse spiders now have a chance to be able to spawn an egg cluster after
      spawning, instead of needing to feed first.
  - tweak: Egg clusters now take slightly more time to spawn spiderlings.
  - tweak: Nurse spiders will no longer cocoon items.
