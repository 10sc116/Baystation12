changes:
  - tweak: Z8 rifles and Z9 rifles use interchangeable magazines. They are NOT loaded
      with the same ammo.
  - tweak: Z9 rifles are now military caliber. The bullets do the same damage as before,
      they're just grey and 7mmR now.
  - tweak: Weapons that can load different magazines, like the bullpups and the L6
      SAW, have a chance to jam when using their non-native type.
  - tweak: Practice rifle rounds are now blue-tipped for better distinction.
