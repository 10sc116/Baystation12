changes:
  - rscadd: While unconscious or asleep, you may now get bolded message similar to
      dreams to indicate that you're being treated, floating in a cryo tube, sitting
      in a sleeper with stasis, or on an operating table - these are added with the
      goal of helping someone understand what's happening to them even though they
      can't see around them while unconscious.
  - rscadd: Added a codex entry describing how SSD messages are displayed from a mechanical
      perspective.
  - spellcheck: Ghosted mobs now have a distinct examine message from disconnected
      mobs.
