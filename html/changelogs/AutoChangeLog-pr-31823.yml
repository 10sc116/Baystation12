changes:
  - tweak: "Gas scanner UI for both the scanner device and PDA module has been tweaked.\
      \ Results no longer appear in chat and instead appear in the scanner's display,\
      \ which will automatically open/update every time a scan is run. The display\
      \ will also now display all information instead of being divided between 3 different\
      \ 'Modes'. NOTE: The PDA module will not automatically open the program if it\
      \ is not already open, but will update the UI if the window is already open."
  - bugfix: Gas scanner PDA modules now work on turfs.
