changes:
  - bugfix: Badges, medals, patches, qualification pins, etc no longer appear to be
      pinned to a mob's chest when their uniforms are rolled down.
  - tweak: Webbing vests, storage pouches, scarves, and armbands now remain visible
      when the uniform they're attached to is rolled down.
