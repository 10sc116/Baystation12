changes:
  - tweak: Blobs will no longer expand onto dense objects, instead trying to attack
      and destroy them before taking the tile if they are objects that use standardized
      health.
  - tweak: Blobs will no longer expand onto tiles housing a standing mob. If you fall
      over, however, the blob will happily consume you.
  - tweak: Blobs will not target or attack canisters or fuel tanks, to avoid blobs
      becoming self-detonating hellgas monsters.
