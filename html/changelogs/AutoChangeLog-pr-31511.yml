changes:
  - bugfix: Barricades and grilles no longer take damage from radiation, EMPs, and
      other non-physical damage sources.
  - tweak: Grilles no longer have a 90% resistance to brute damage (Why was that even
      a thing?).
  - tweak: Barricades now have a flat 133% health modifier instead of a resistance
      boost to some damage types.
