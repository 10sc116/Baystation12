changes:
  - tweak: Using a cult talisman on a mob carrying a null rod now also deletes the
      talisman alongside the pre-existing behaviour of blocking the effects.
  - tweak: Cult Talismans can now only be invoked on certain types of atoms, depending
      on their effect. EMP talismans can be used on mobs or machinery, while stun
      talismans can only be used on carbon or silicon mobs. This also prevents accidentally
      burning a talisman on a turfor object when trying to click a moving target.
  - rscadd: Cult Talismans can now be examined to see the type of talisman and their
      effects, if you're a cultist.
  - rscadd: Cult talismans now have codex entries.
  - rscadd: Cult talismans now have a sound effect that plays when used. Stun talismans
      make the flash sound effect, EMP talismans make the EMP sound effect.
  - admin: All cult talismans now properly generate attack logs when used.
