changes:
  - bugfix: Grilles on wires will now shock users that hit them.
  - bugfix: Inflatables will no longer take damage from melee weapons that can't puncture
      or with a weak damage value.
  - bugfix: Table deconstruction steps can now be performed on disarm or grab intent.
      Harm intent will still attack the table, and help intent will still place items
      on the table.
