changes:
  - rscadd: Adds aquaculture. Seed vendors now contain 5 packets each of clam, oyster,
      mussel, shrimp, and crab eggs, which can be planted in hydroponics trays. Additional
      eggs can be purchased from Supply. Shellfish need to be cracked with a knife
      before eating or cooking, except crabs, which are butchered as normal.
  - rscadd: 3 new aquaculture-based cooking recipes added.
  - tweak: Hydroponics satchels and SmartFridges can hold shellfish.
  - tweak: Butchering crab simplemobs yields crab legs (including exoplant crabs).
  - tweak: Seed display names standardized, minor fixes to hydroponics readout and
      examine text.
