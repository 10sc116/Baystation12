changes:
  - bugfix: Bloodbags now spawn with the correct blood color based on their initial
      contents.
  - maptweak: Medbay's nanoblood supply has been replaced with O- human blood. The
      number of pre-filled blood bags has been doubled to counter the reduced efficiency
      compared to nanoblood bags. Two packs of skrellian and two packs of unathi blood
      has also been added to the blood locker.
  - rscadd: 'Human, unathi, and skrell O- blood packs are now available through supply.
      Costs of nanoblood and blood packs have been adjusted: Nanoblood is now 30 credits,
      skrell and unathi blood is 20 credits, and human blood is 15.'
