changes:
  - bugfix: Removed deployed augments undeploy when removed - no more items stuck
      in hands.
  - tweak: Augment installation respects the target doll - no more weird screwdriver
      shenanigans.
  - tweak: Augment examine is more descriptive of what the augment can be installed
      in.
  - tweak: CBMs are now Augment Autodocs and also respect the target doll.
  - tweak: Loadout augments are properly categorized. You will need to re-select them.
  - tweak: You can take loadout augment HUDs you don't start with the access to actually
      use.
