changes:
  - tweak: 'Windows now have a minimum damage threshold based on the hardness of their
      material before they can actually be damaged by melee attacks, adjustments to
      their health calculation based on material integrity, and now have proper armor
      handling for melee attacks (Projectile processing for walls already had this).
      Walls are overall more robust when attacking them. See PR #30429 for specifics.'
