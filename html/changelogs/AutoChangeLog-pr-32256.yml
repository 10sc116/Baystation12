  - balance: Explosion damage handling for walls and other standardized health atoms
      has been tweaked. Overall, explosions are now more damaging in general, and
      walls using plasteel as a material are now far less resilient to explosions
      than they used to be, while still being about 1/3 - 1/2 stronger. See https://github.com/Baystation12/Baystation12/pull/32256
      for specific numbers.
