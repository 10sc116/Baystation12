  - tweak: All timed actions now, by default, have the 'Unique' flag set. This means
      that a user can only perform one timed action at a time, and a target can only
      have one user performing a timed action on them at a time. Medical bandaging,
      CPR, injecting, and surgical steps are exempt from unique checks for balance
      reasons.
