delete-after: true
changes:
  - tweak: Various existing do_after() timers are now configured to allow the user
      to only perform one action and the target to have one action performed on them
      at a time. This ONLY affects interactions that already had a timer associated
      with them and does not add any new timers. Notable exceptions are provided in
      the PR. See https://github.com/Baystation12/Baystation12/pull/32010
  - tweak: Various existing do_after() timers now display public progress bars.
