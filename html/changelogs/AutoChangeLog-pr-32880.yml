changes:
  - bugfix: Walls and doors now properly respect their material's melting points during
      fire damage checks.
  - bugfix: Grilles no longer receive damage twice from fires.
  - balance: Fire doors and cameras now use plasteel's heat resistance value (~6,000
      kelvin). Up from steel (~1,800).
  - balance: Fire damage is now reduced by the atom's melting point value. By default,
      this is 100C (373K).
  - maptweak: Replaced the engine hatch doors with blast doors labelled as 'Engine
      Access Hatch'. These doors can be toggled by a new button located in the engine
      monitoring room, next to all the other emergency buttons (It's the far left
      one).
