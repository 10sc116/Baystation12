changes:
  - rscadd: you can now powder pills with anything sharp, or your ID.
  - rscadd: with thalers, straws or rolling paper, you can snort these to have them

      a mouth can't do this.
  - rscadd: Most drugs dont cause moaning, screaming, giggling or laughing at random
      anymore. Those who still do, are much subtler, or require higher doses. Some
      have received different effects like stuttering instead.
  - rscadd: they have also received unique messages for the person when you are under
      their effect, and withdrawal.
  - rscadd: Lactic acid is no longer referred to as lactate.
