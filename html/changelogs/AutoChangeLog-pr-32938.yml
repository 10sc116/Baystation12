changes:
  - tweak: Blast doors now have a much higher fire resistance of 10,000 kelvin. This
      should allow them to withstand the incinerator and nacelle burn chambers.
  - tweak: 'Certain atoms now protect other atoms on the same tile from taking fire
      damage, at least until they break. The atoms, in the order they are checked
      and affected, are: Closed blast and fire doors, closed doors, and windows.'
  - maptweak: The incinerator now has blast doors added to cover the two airlocks,
      so your fires don't destroy them.
