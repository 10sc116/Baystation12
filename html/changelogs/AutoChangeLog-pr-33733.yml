changes:
  - tweak: Buckshot accuracy is now calculated once per shot, rather than individually
      for each pellet.
  - tweak: Shotguns are generally more accurate at range (to account for accuracy
      only being calculated once)
  - bugfix: Fixes pump shotgun sprites inaccurately displaying the condition of the
      shotgun
