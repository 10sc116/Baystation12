changes:
  - tweak: Suicide now accounts for damage, what you're wearing, where your brain
      actually is, utilizes aim mode, and is now triggered manually instead of being
      on a timer.
  - bugfix: People who suicide are no longer save-able via MMI.
  - bugfix: Suicide via less-than-lethal weapons is no longer easy to to.
