changes:
  - balance: Effective range of EMP grenades reduced from 10 tiles to 5.
  - balance: Heavy severity range of EMP grenades reduced from 4 tiles to 2.
  - bugfix: Fixed low yield EMP grenade range being limited to 1 tile; Low-yield grenades
      now have an effective range of 3 tiles and a heavy severity range of 1 tile.
  - balance: Ion projectile effective splash range reduced from 2 to 1. To be effective,
      ion rifles now must hit their target or hit the target's turf. This change now
      makes the difference between ion rifles and ion pistols solely the strength
      of the EMP effect and no longer the additional splash radius.
