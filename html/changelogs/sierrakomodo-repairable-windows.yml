# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.

changes:
  - rscadd: "Windows can now be repaired. The steps are use glass sheets of the exact same material as the window was made of, then weld. The number of glass sheets needed will depend on the window."
  - tweak: "Shattered windows now drop a random number of materials, making destroying them a net loss in resources."
  - tweak: "Windows now show the material they're reinforced with when examined."
