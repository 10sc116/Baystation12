changes:
  - bugfix: Wearable objects that can go in more than one slot (e.g. bandanas, towels,
      cigarettes, gum/lollipops, berets, toilet paper) now render correctly for Vox
      and Unathi.
  - tweak: Minor sprite tweaks for Unathi bandanas + a few other hats, added some
      icons for recently PR'd clothes.
