changes:
  - tweak: Garden and Xenobotany seed vendors have been alphabetized. Garden and Xenobotany
      seed vendors now have the same contents, besides random Xenobotany seeds.
  - tweak: Missing low-grade tobacco seeds now exists. Low-grade tobacco stats (color,
      nutrient consumption rate) have been tweaked slightly to be distinct from regular
      tobacco.
  - tweak: All grape variants can evolve into all other grape variants.
  - bugfix: Green grapes are now green. White grapes now display as "white grape"
      rather than "white grape seeds".
