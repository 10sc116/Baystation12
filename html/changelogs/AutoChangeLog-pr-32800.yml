changes:
  - tweak: Default ship sensor range overheat threshhold reduced to 3, bringing it
      back in line to previous values. This allows upgrading the sensors with better
      manipulators to become viable. Maximum possible upgraded range before overheating
      is 6.
  - tweak: Ship sensor range inputs now only accept whole numbers, and will round
      any decimal value entered.
  - rscdel: The weak variant of ship sensors has been removed. The GUP's sensors are
      now equivalent to all other sensors.
