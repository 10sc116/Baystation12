changes:
  - rscadd: Newly-added access_network_admin has replaced access_network, and access_network
      is now used to give a lesser degree of access to NTNet through terminal commands
      than admins have. Jobs that previously had access_network now have access_network_admin
      as well, and access_network has been added to engineers, roboticists and forensic
      investigators.
  - rscadd: Several new terminal commands have been added and some existing ones have
      been revised. Details on available commands can be accessed through the 'man'
      command as usual.
  - rscadd: Individual files or programs on a hard drive or portable drive can be
      flagged as invisible through terminal-usage, hiding them from view in most NTOS
      applications.
  - rscadd: Entire drives can be made read-only through terminal-usage. Files on read-only
      drives cannot be edited or deleted, and new files cannot be created.
  - tweak: Network cards can be given custom identifiers through terminal-usage, for
      easier recognition on NTNet.
  - tweak: Programs set to autorun can now have autorun toggled off by clicking the
      autorun button again.
  - tweak: When wireless access for specific NTNet functions is disabled, the connection
      is only rejected if the last device in a proxy chain is a wireless device.
  - balance: access restrictions are now bypassed for the ssh terminal command when
      used from an emagged computer. Antag hackers rejoice!
  - bugfix: The number of programs that a modular computer can run simultaneously
      is once again limited by the installed CPU.
