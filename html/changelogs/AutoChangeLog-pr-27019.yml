changes: 
  - tweak: "Stun acts (from weapons) will now take existing pain of limbs and any painkillers into account."
  - tweak: "Stun acts will now rely on pain to calculate, so damaged limbs will go down to stuns easier. It also means it longer affect robotic limbs or anything that can't feel pain. Ya IPC!"
  - tweak: "Painkillers will now resist some stun effect due to them blocking pain."
  - tweak: "Stun weaponry now deals a very small amount of burn for flavor, 1-3 burn depending on the gun."
  - bugfix: "Stun act will now work properly on body shots, bringing down targets with enough pain on chest/head/groin shots."
  - tweak: "Robolimbs will no longer have blurry eye/ stutter or create adrenaline upon being hurt."
  - tweak: "Adjusted some stun and shock duration, lowering most of it."
  - tweak: "Shock has a lower tier stun effect, stunning people that takes 10-15 damage for 2 seconds."
  - tweak: "Shock and Stuns weapon inconsistency and damage has been adjusted."
  - tweak: "Shock will now activate a weak local EMP on the limb they hit (if they deal more than 10 dmg), frying any implants, augments or synthetic organs inside and also the limb they hit. They will neutralise an IPC/FBP after 3/4 shock shots to the chest, frying their microbattery."
  - tweak: "EMP on robotic limbs will make them fail. EG. as Shock beam to a roboleg will cause it to collapse."
  - tweak: "EMP now deals more damage to internal synthetic organs."
  - tweak: "Implants are now vulnerable to EMP if they weren't already. EG, shock beam might fry, disables or activate the implant."
  - tweak: "Security and Engineering (not atmospherics) voidsuit is slightly more insulated against shocks and stuns. Still not as a good as a hardsuit."
  - tweak: "Light bulbs can be taken down without gloves, on non help intent, for extra badassery."
  - tweak: "Wall toss will now take armor calculations into account."
  - tweak: "Rejuvenate will now restore stamina."
