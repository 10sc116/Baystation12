changes:
  - tweak: Hostage meat shields are forced to stand until they go unconscious/die,
      then stop blocking shots
  - tweak: Hostage/assailant can no longer be pulled away from each other while being
      used as a meat shield
  - bugfix: Pulling an assailant away from their grab target makes them properly drop
      the grab
