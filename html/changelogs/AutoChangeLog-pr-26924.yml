  - rscadd: "Adds pencode tags [pre] [fontblue] [fontred] [fontgreen], with closing [/pre] and [/font] universal for the three fonts. They only work digitally with nanoword, emails, report editors and direct txt files. Font color gives color, [pre] gives monospace font and preserves whitespace spaces only and not tabs, e.g. for ascii art."
  - rscadd: "Gas analyzers now show total moles, total volume and moles per gas, check codex for more info."
  - bugfix: "Fixed robot inventory not updating automatically when dropping items which are stored back into it."
  - bugfix: "Saving emails to a txt file on disk now works correctly and can be printed with the new tags."
