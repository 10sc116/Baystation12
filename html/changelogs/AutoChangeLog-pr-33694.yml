changes:
  - tweak: The amount of soda in the cola machine is now randomly generated. This
      is an experiment, should not cause any shortages.
  - tweak: Vending machines now display rare items in gold, hidden items (contraband
      wire/emag) in orange.
  - tweak: Emagging a vendor now makes all items free.
  - bugfix: Wooden crates now properly spawn wood instead of metal when crowbar'd
      open.
