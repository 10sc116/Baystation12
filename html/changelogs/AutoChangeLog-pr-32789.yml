changes:
  - tweak: Hand labelers will now skip all other interactions except labeling while
      turned on. This means they won't toggle locker locks or any other weirdness
      while also attaching labels. While the labeler is turned off, it will go into
      containers and behave as usual.
  - bugfix: Hand labelers will no long turn on if you provide an invalid or empty
      string as the label text.
  - rscadd: Added codex mechanics to hand labelers.
