changes:
  - rscadd: You can now toggle your HUDs on and off, without having to remove them,
      in case you wanted to pull off the look while resting your eyes. Includes new
      sprites for when they're off, and flashy sound effects to boot.
  - rscadd: The science nerds can now get prescription Science HUDs so they can be
      even nerdier. Available in loadout.
  - tweak: Tweaked the Medical HUD visor colors slightly to better match normal medHUD
      colors.
  - tweak: EMPs now don't blind you if your HUD or goggles are deactivated. Security
      HUDs also don't protect from flashes if they're not active.
  - bugfix: HUDs no longer say that you're blinded after being EMP'd when they're
      not on your eyes.
