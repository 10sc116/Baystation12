changes:
  - tweak: Removing webbing from other mobs with an item in your hand now requires
      you to be on a non-harm intent. If on harm intent, you'll just hit them instead.
      Now you can take advantage of that webbed up victim you wanted to kill anyway!
  - tweak: Security bots now react to being attacked with a melee weapon/tool, even
      if the attack does no damage.
  - tweak: Attacking simple mobs with melee weapons/tools now requires being on harm
      intent.
  - tweak: Repairing cyborgs with a welding tool or cable coil now requires 1 units
      of fuel per repair and includes a 1 second timer.
  - tweak: Using a screwdriver on a borg now gives you the option of accessing the
      wiring or radio, instead of the decision being decided by the presence of a
      power cell. Opening the wiring panel still requires the power cell to be removed
      first.
  - tweak: Various tool based interactions with mobs now all include failure feedback
      messages, and visual messages on success.
  - tweak: pAIs no longer fold when attacked.
