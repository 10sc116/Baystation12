changes:
  - tweak: Clicking "Show Goals" tells you that they are disabled in preferences if
      they are.
  - tweak: Jobs allow 0 to 5 personal goals by default, instead of 1 to 3.
  - bugfix: Removing/re-rolling goals acts on the correct goals if used more than
      once.
  - bugfix: You cannot roll the same goal twice in the same set, or no goal if re-rolling
      one.
