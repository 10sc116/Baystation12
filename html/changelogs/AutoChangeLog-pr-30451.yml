  - rscadd: Papers are now written in languages. If you understand the language, you
      can read it. If not, it has the same effects as hearing people talking in a
      language you don't understand. You can set the language you're writing in when
      writing on a blank sheet by clicking the language name at the top of the paper's
      UI window. ZAC is used by default for each paper.
  - admin: The fax prompt now has a 'Change Language' button to set what language
      the fax is written in. ZAC is used by default.
