  - rscadd: "New message highlighting will indicate to you when new messages are visible to you across any tab"
  - rscadd: "Line combining. Repeat messages sent one after another will combine in order to reduce clutter."
  - rscadd: "animated messages. User toggle setting to have text fade in instead of their normal behavior."
  - rscadd: "Configurable line height, allowing you to change the distance between lines in the chat box."
  - rscadd: "Chat persistence. If you lose connection, when you reconnect you'll automatically retain any of the last 200 messages you've seen."
  - rscadd: "Vchat preference toggle added. If you'd prefer to use the legacy old chat, you can do so by toggling Use Fancy Chat in your preferences. Changing between the two should be more or less seamless, as the last 200 messages will be preserved in either mode."
