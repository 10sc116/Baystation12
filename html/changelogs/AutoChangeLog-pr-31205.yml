changes:
  - maptweak: Security processing's window tint also tints the interior hall windows.
  - maptweak: The BC no longer needs to leave their desk to access the window to processing.
  - maptweak: Moves the BC's hall-facing window so the BC no longer reaches through
      a solid window to access their requests console.
