changes:
  - tweak: Attacking energy nets with your bare hands or melee weapons now requires
      you to be on harm intent.
  - tweak: You can now damage doors that are open.
  - bugfix: Items and machinery that use standardize health will no longer delete
      themselves from explosions if the explosion didn't kill them.
