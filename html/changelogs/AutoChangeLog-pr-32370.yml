delete-after: true
changes:
  - tweak: Lava now correctly damages atoms using standardized health instead of just
      deleting them immediately. Atoms that die to the resulting fire damage still
      cease existing.
  - tweak: Atoms with immunity to fire damage are now immune to lava damage as well.
