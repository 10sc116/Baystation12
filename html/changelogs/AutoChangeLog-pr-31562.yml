changes:
  - maptweak: The Aquila now scrubs air to space instead of to a canister.
  - maptweak: The Aquila now has a pressure canister for CO2, starting with a pittance
      of spare gas.
  - maptweak: The Aquila has three less thrusters, making it slightly more fuel efficient
      at a cost of max acceleration per burn.
