  - admin: The 'Who' verb will now list the specific antag type next to a player's
      name if they are playing as one.
  - admin: Staff can now see all players' readied status regardless of hidden status,
      and can now see what antag roles they are readied for in respect to the current
      gamemode (other than secret).
