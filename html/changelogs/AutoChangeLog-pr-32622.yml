changes:
  - bugfix: Unrefillable welding tool tanks can no longer be refueled using a weldpack.
  - tweak: Welding packs now inform you if the tool you are attempting to refill is
      already full
  - tweak: Weldpacks no longer have a 50% chance of exploding when you use a lit torch
      on them. Instead, they will only explode if you're on harm intent. Otherwise,
      it tells you no and does nothing.
