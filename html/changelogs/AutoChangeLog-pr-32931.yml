  - rscadd: Codex entries can now include a list of various click and item interactions.
      These still have to be manually written, but are nicely formatted as a list
      and includes interactions provided by parent types. These can be found at the
      bottom of the OOC Information and Antagonist Information sections of any given
      item's codex entry, which in turn is accessed by clicking the codex link that
      appears when examining items, or searching through the Codex index found with
      the 'codex' verb.
