changes:
  - tweak: IV stands and roller beds use IV bag transfer rates and allow setting their
      currently hung bag rate. IV bags can be set to 2, 1, REM, or 0.
  - tweak: It's easier to mess up with IVs. With less than basic medicine you'll be
      slow and likely to stab people by accident on rollers and stands. IV bags want
      trained instead.
  - tweak: You can hook up IV bags to people and squeeze them every three seconds
      to force in extra fluid. Harm intent is painful but pushes an extra three times
      the transfer rate. Other intents only push twice as much, but also only itch.
  - tweak: Setting up and collapsing roller beds takes a few seconds. The horror.
  - tweak: You can iron people on ironing boards. They sizzle. Also implements the
      fancy ironing board icon.
  - tweak: Roller beds and ironing boards with mobs buckled to them become turf-level
      mouse opaque. Clicking the mob will still interact with the mob, but you can
      click anywhere on the turf to interact with the bed / board.
  - tweak: Mapped blood pack distribution changed to include less nanoblood (but still
      some) and a mixture of other bloods.
  - tweak: IV bag contents is indicated with labels. You can remove the labels. Isn't
      that lovely?
